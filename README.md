# Project objective:  
This project aims to showcase the skills we have learned in the University of Birmingham's Data Analytics Bootcamp
to date.  

# Overview

## Dataset  

We obtained our dataset from Kaggle and it provides a complete overview of the properties within Glasgow's postcodes
by ownership, split between the Housing Association and others. While this dataset contained a "cleaned" version of the data, 
we decided to use the base dataset and demonstrate our data-cleaning skills. A link to the dataset can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/dimodimchev/glasgow-housing-association-properties) and also in
the resources folder. A limitation of this dataset is that the data was that it was last updated in May 2022.

## Methodology  

### Data review and cleaning

After selecting our Kaggle dataset we used a Jupyter Notebook and Pandas. Using Pandas we could quickly and easily identify the
completeness of data. The dataset was read into Pandas using the _read_csv_ function. The cleaned data was the exported as a new CSV 
to be used later.

In addition to the Kaggle dataset, we required a geoJSON file of the Glasgow postcodes
